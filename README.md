# ML-Models-from-Scratch

Several Machine Learning models were implemented from the scratch in the python langauage by just making use of Numpy library. Through out the project based on the specific model, I've used either one or both publicly available datasets:
1. Mushroom dataset: a simple categorical binary classification dataset
2. CIFAR-10: a multi-class image classification dataset

The motivation behind these projects is to understand the fundamentals of a few classic methods also to get experience in hyperparameter tuning and using proper train/validation/test data splits.

The implemented models include:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. Perceptron
4. Softmax
5. Multi Layer Nueral Network with Gradient Descent Optimization
6. Multi Layer Nueral Network with Adam Optimizer
